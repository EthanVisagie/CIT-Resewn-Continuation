## 1.2.2-fork.5+26.1

### Fixed

- Ported CIT Resewn Continuation to Minecraft 26.1/Fabric.
- Restored Barely Default elytra CIT loading on 26.1.
- Fixed worn/damaged elytra variant priority so low-durability textures resolve correctly.

## 1.2.2-fork.5+1.21.11

### Fixed

- Restored legacy `nbt.Damage=...` condition support for Minecraft 1.21.11.

- Added ISO-8859-1/Latin-1 fallback parsing for `.properties` files that are not valid UTF-8.
- Fixed armor CIT loading when packs contain invalid legacy item ids.
- Added a turtle shell armor compatibility alias for legacy `texture.turtle_layer_1=...` rules on modern `turtle_scute` equipment assets.
- Preserved sorted elytra CIT selection order so worn elytra variants respect weight/path priority.
- Updated the Fabric API dependency id from `fabric` to `fabric-api`.

## 1.2.2-fork.3+1.21.11

1. Fixed item CITs that use both `model` and `texture`.
2. The resolved `texture` value now replaces `layer0` in the custom model.
